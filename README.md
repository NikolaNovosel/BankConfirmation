I am creating the project to deliver application to workers in the banking sector. The goal is to make it easy for employees to choose and download relevant confirmations for their clients.
As part of the project requirements, I first created 10 tables in SQL. To demonstrate ADO.NET data access technology, I created procedures in SQL for some tables to showcase CRUD operations. I later utilized these procedures in ADO.NET to execute relevant commands. For my second project, I created a set of interfaces that use entities as return types or parameters in their methods.
I am building the project using a three-layer architecture. The first layer represents the data access layer, where I used ADO.NET and Entity Framework. The next layer is the business logic layer (BL), which calls upon the data access layer (DA) and its relevant interfaces. I implemented the Factory Design Pattern in the business logic layer to achieve polymorphism using an Interface as the base type, meeting the project's intended requirements. The final layer (excluding the REST project) is the UI layer, which consists of two projects: one built with MVC framework and the other with WF (Windows Forms) framework. For now, presentation in WF project consist of the Account table with its GetAll() method. In MVC, I created CRUD operations for pages titled 'Account,' 'Client,' and 'Credit.' Among them is a specific page titled 'Select By Client,' which uses a jQuery Ajax GET method call instead of ADO/EF access. All pages are accessible under their respective navbar drop-down menus. I am using ADO technology for the Client entity and Entity Framework for the Account and Credit parts.
